# Reflections

This repository reflects my learning and understanding of remote work expectations, developed through formal training with the **Institute of Career and Professional Skills (ICPS)**.

Key takeaways:
- Professional behavior matters as much as technical ability
- Clear communication reduces misunderstandings in remote teams
- Consistency and accountability build long-term trust

These principles guide my approach to remote work and professional conduct.
